# Weather Dashboard

This project is centered on creating a site to help users know the weather in places they are interested. Weather data includes today's data as well as the forecast for the next 5 days from today. When you search a city it is added to your search history and can be easily selected in the future. If a city is not known, the user is alerted that their requested city is not found.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. knowledge of javascript would be helpful if you would like to add more functionality to the weather app.
View the site here: [Weather App](https://dancornutt.github.io/UWB-06HW-WeatherDashboard/)

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a good text editor or IDE for making edits to the code. For this project VS Code was used and was very useful.
Below are the tools used for this site:
    * Text Editor
    * Git
    * Github account
    * Browser (Chrome was used for development)

### Installing

These are the installation steps to get the site up and running:

    * Log into Github
    * Fork this repo 
    * Clone your Forked repo on your local machine
    * Navigate to the index.html file and open it in your favorite browser

## Running the tests

No tests were constructed, this is an area of opportunity for any one interested in collaborating.

## Deployment

This site is hosted via GitHub, note that a object called "WeatherAppCities" will be added to your local storage in the browser. It is recommended to clear this object if the site is no longer in use.
